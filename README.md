Self-Critique

With more time on my hands, I would definitely try to somehow make the text in the sidebar relative to the paragraph in the "main". In my case, I used "br" several times to introduce empty spaces but I do not believe it was the right way of doing, knowing that the layout may appear differently according to the clients's screen. Secondly, it would be ideal for the images to "shrink" or adjusted whenever the page is made smaller or bigger. My project demonstrates a case where the images overlaps on the sidebar whenever the page is made smaller. Also maybe make the images' captions relative to their respective image instead of setting all captions to one specific spot through out the webpage.
